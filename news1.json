      "title": "Introducing Incremental Refresh Policies for Dataflows in Power BI",
      "source": "Microsoft Power BI Blog",
      "content": "Today, we're excited to announce the general availability of incremental refresh policies for dataflows in Power BI. This highly requested feature enables more efficient data refresh processes, reduced load on data sources, and faster refresh times for your large datasets.\n\nIncremental refresh allows you to refresh only the data that has changed since the last refresh operation, rather than refreshing the entire dataset. This is particularly valuable for large datasets where refreshing all data would be time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n\nWith this release, Power BI dataflows now support the same incremental refresh capabilities that have been available in Power BI datasets. You can define refresh policies based on date/time parameters, allowing you to specify which data should be refreshed and which should be retained from previous refreshes.\n\n## How to Configure Incremental Refresh\n\nSetting up incremental refresh for your dataflows is straightforward:\n\n1. Open Power BI service and navigate to the workspace containing your dataflow\n2. Edit the dataflow and select the entity you want to configure\n3. Click on the \"Incremental Refresh\" button in the toolbar\n4. Define your refresh parameters including:\n   - RangeStart and RangeEnd parameters\n   - Refresh window (how far back to refresh data)\n   - Archive window (how much historical data to retain)\n\nOnce configured, Power BI will automatically apply your incremental refresh policy during scheduled refreshes.\n\n## Benefits for Enterprise Scenarios\n\nFor enterprise users working with large datasets, incremental refresh offers several key benefits:\n\n- **Reduced refresh times**: Only refresh data that has changed\n- **More reliable refreshes**: Shorter refresh operations are less likely to timeout\n- **Lower source system load**: Minimize impact on source databases\n- **Efficient resource utilization**: Better use of Power BI capacity resources\n\n## Limitations and Considerations\n\nWhen implementing incremental refresh policies, keep in mind these important considerations:\n\n- Incremental refresh is available for dataflows in Premium and Embedded capacities\n- The dataflow must include date/time columns to define refresh ranges\n- Initial refresh operations will still process all data\n- Certain dataflow transformations might affect how incremental refresh policies work\n\n## What's Next\n\nWe're continuing to improve dataflow capabilities in Power BI. In the coming months, you can expect additional features that will enhance your data preparation and management workflows, including enhanced compute engine support and new transformation capabilities.\n\nWe encourage you to try the new incremental refresh policies for dataflows and share your feedback through the Power BI Ideas forum or community discussions. Your input directly influences our product roadmap and helps us deliver the features you need.\n\nTo learn more about incremental refresh in Power BI, review our detailed documentation which includes step-by-step guidance and best practices for implementation in enterprise environments.",
