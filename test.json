    "content": "Did you know that developers use an average of 16 tools per day? A typical developer works across their code editor, a terminal, several command-line tools and web portals – not to mention all the SDKs and packages they take a dependency on in their code. Sometimes it can be challenging to figure out how to make it all work together. If you’re tasked with providing guidance and common infrastructure for other developers on your team, you may need to wrestle with many more tools and services. Whether you use the Visual Studio family of IDEs, GitHub, Azure DevOps or build apps for Azure, Windows, M365, Teams or Microsoft Copilot, now more than ever, we need a place to share with you how you can use our products together so you can focus on writing the code that’s unique to your organization. Microsoft for Developers will strive to tell the full end-to-end story for developers as they build and infuse their applications with AI, migrate their applications to the cloud, or take advantage of the latest features and platform capabilities. You’ll find updates on how to become more productive than ever as we integrate all of our tools and services with GitHub Copilot and surface the knowledge in the code editors that you use every day. Developer blogs here at Microsoft are trusted by millions of developers to get deep insight and the latest news about the products they love – directly from the product teams at Microsoft that build them. Our plan is to not change anything about the current developer blog ecosystem that developers trust. You’ll still get all of your product-specific updates and insights from blogs such as .NET, Visual Studio, VS Code, GitHub, and so many more. Think of this new blog as a unified hub for major announcements that span multiple products and deep insights into making them all work for you. Often adopting new technology requires culture change in the form of upskilling, changing organizational structure or job content. We’ll share insights and best practices for DevSecOps, platform engineering, cloud-native architectures, building with AI, and enterprise integration. Finally, we’ll share your stories about how you’re using these products and services together to build world class applications and services to empower people around the world to achieve more.
